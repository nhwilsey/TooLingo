				This is Toolingo, a unique webapp built to connect people around the world with the common goal to learn a language. 
			But here is the catch, the way you learn is by getting matched with someone who wants to learn a language you know, and who knows the language you want to learn. 
			Thus, Toolingo helps you get connected and learn through actual conservations with real people, while also helping them learn the language they've always wanted to learn.
			Toolingo's matching service is GREAT FREE way to learn a language and connect with a diverse range of people from all around the world!
